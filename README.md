# About
This SFML-Based 2D-Engine started as a one-semester-approach trying to get an Engine running.
It has simple but working features like:
- ECS
- InputManager
- ResourceManager
- BMP-De-/Serializer
- Console-Debugger
- UI-Elements (Button, InputField, Slider...)

It's basically a mini-project to get me more familiar with C++. 

# Example
Currently the Example is a Cellular Automata World-Generator used as my SemesterElective-Submission.
You can access it simply by running the application.

# Build
1. Download [CMake](cmake.org/download/)
2. Make sure CMake is in the User PATH VARIABLES
3. VISUAL STUDIO:   
- if not done already, install Workload "Desktop develoment with C++" via "Visual Studio Installer" for your current Visual Studio
- run build.bat (automatically opens Visual Studio)
5. ALTERNATIVE:     Generate into a new subdirectory called "build" with the IDE of your choice
